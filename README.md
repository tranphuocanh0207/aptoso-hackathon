# 🎉 Welcome to Aptoso SocialFi 🎉

Earn Tokens While You Scroll Twitter

# 📜 About Us

Aptoso is a SocialFi Chrome extension built on the Aptos blockchain, designed to transform how users interact with social media. It allows everyday Twitter users to earn crypto tokens simply by completing small, verifiable tasks — such as liking, retweeting, commenting, or quoting posts from verified campaigns.

For Web3 projects, Aptoso offers a powerful new tool to drive authentic social engagement. Projects can launch campaigns directly through Aptoso, define tasks and eligibility (like minimum followers, wallet token balance, or GetMoni score), and deposit rewards in advance. The platform verifies user actions in real-time via DOM parsing and distributes rewards automatically on-chain.

Everything happens seamlessly within Twitter. Users continue scrolling as usual, while the Aptoso overlay detects eligible posts, shows pending quests, and tracks progress. No need to switch tabs, submit screenshots, or connect third-party platforms.

Whether you're a project looking to go viral or a user looking to earn by engaging, Aptoso bridges attention and value — effortlessly.

Install the extension. Join a campaign. Earn as you tweet.

→ Powered by Aptos. Designed for everyone.
